Afternoon Game Showcase:

Sunday afternoon we've teamed with The Grid District to provide playable, locally made videogames for the Worcester community-at-large to try out and have fun. This is a family friendly event, and you don't have to work on games to enjoy playing them so stop by and try some out.

Mass DiGI's Summer Innovation Program '17 participants will be demoing each of the four games in development at the program this summer. Other games from local developers will also be shown. Stay tuned for more details!

Battle Decks Woo:

Hot off the heels of the PAX East 2017 battle, Battle Decks comes to Worcester to see who can pitch the best, and most ridiculous, game ideas they’ve never seen before! The presentations will start at 6:30pm and contestants will have 5 minutes to pitch a powerpoint deck for a game idea they’ve never seen.

Still not following? That's fine! While you wait for this year’s PAX Battle Decks video, check out the debut panel at PAX East 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAm5UqLCNk&t=1640s.

NOTE: Wraps from Techni Mediterranean Grill will be provided during Battle Decks Woo, and demos will still be available to play at that time.
